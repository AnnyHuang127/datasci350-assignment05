    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysiss (Q3)\n\nIn this section, I plan to look at three key development indicators for 2022: GDP per capita, life expectancy, and unemployment rate.\n\n1. GDP per Capita\nGDP per capita measures the average economic output per person and is often used as an indicator of a country’s standard of living.\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n    259    2571    7588   20346   25983  240862      14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the distribution is strongly right-skewed, indicating that most countries have relatively low to middle income levels, while a small number of countries have very high GDP per capita.\n\n\n\n2. Life Expectancy\nLife expectancy represents the average number of years a newborn is expected to live under current mortality conditions.\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n  53.00   66.78   73.51   72.42   78.47   85.38       8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife expectancy appears more normally distributed compared to GDP per capita. Most countries cluster between 65 and 80 years, with fewer countries experiencing extremely low life expectancy.\n\n3. Unemployment Rate\nThe unemployment rate measures the percentage of the labor force that is without work but actively seeking employment.\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n  0.130   3.501   5.537   7.269   9.455  37.852      31 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment rates vary considerably across countries. While many countries report moderate unemployment levels, a subset experiences very high unemployment, suggesting structural labor market challenges."

Data source: World Bank WDI (sample in wdi.csv).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Figure 1 shows that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher life expectancy, with diminishing returns at the high-income end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Top 10 countries by GDP per capita in 2022. Data source: World Bank WDI (sample in wdi.csv).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Figure 2 presents the top 10 countries ranked by GDP per capita in 2022. The distribution highlights substantial disparities in income levels across countries. The highest-income countries significantly outperform others, indicating strong economic productivity and high standards of living. The large gaps between ranks suggest that global income distribution remains highly unequal. This positive association between income and life expectancy has been widely documented in the literature (Preston 1975)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis of the 2022 World Development Indicators highlights substantial variation in economic and social outcomes across countries. GDP per capita exhibits strong inequality, with a small number of high-income countries significantly outperforming others. Life expectancy appears more evenly distributed, though it remains positively associated with economic prosperity. Unemployment rates vary across countries, reflecting structural and economic differences in labour markets.\nOverall, the findings suggest that economic development remains closely linked to health outcomes, while disparities in income and employment conditions continue to shape global inequality patterns."
